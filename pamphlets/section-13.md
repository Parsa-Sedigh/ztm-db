## 265-265 - Quick Note Upcoming Videos
Ready to learn about one of my favourite databases?

Redis is extremely useful and versatile. Although we don't use SQL with Redis, we wanted to include this database inside of
this course because it is such a common database around the industry. The upcoming videos are from my
other course - Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap. Hope you find this bonus section useful by giving you a bigger picture
of the data industry. It should also give you a good idea of how other types of databases are used inside of a company :)
