# Section 2: 2 - History And Story Of Data

## 6-6 - What Is a Database
A database is a collection of data and also a method for us to access and manipulate that data.

Without a DB, the ability to query a DB, that is to ask DB information about it's data, it would be impossible for us do a lot of things.

## 7-7 - I Didnt Learn Anything Try Again
DB is essentially a computer with some DB software on top. For example google sheets or excel are DB. Because they're ways for us to store
data and manipulate that data. A pen and paper is a DB as well(it's not digital though)!

The reason we see cylinders as DBs is because of drum memory. Before we had disk drives, that was how we stored data.
So because of historical reasons, drum memory represents DBs(but in our age, they're all computers).

When we have too much data, excel can't handle it and oon top of that, there are many things that DBs will solve, such as making sure that DB
has integrity(not everybody can just modify data or delete a DB). You can store terabytes ofo data. You can combine different DBs. You can
automate steps and use programs to do some interesting things that you can't do on a spreadsheet.

Since data is different and every company uses data in a different way, we have different DBs that do things differently and each one have
pros and cons.

SQL -> A way for us to interact or communicate with that DB.

## 8-8 - Database Management System DBMS
DBMS: Is a software that is used to manage the DB. It receives instructions from someone and instructs the system(DB) to grab the data or
make changes to data.

RDBMS: A subset off DBMS like postgresql orr mysql. They're a way for us To interact with the data.

Structured query language(SQL): A way for us to interact with a DBMS.

When we refer to a DB, we essentially means: Both data + DBMS.

## 11-11 - 5 Types Of Databases
The 5 types of databases often called the 5 data models:
1) relational model: They support ACID transactions. Work really well with SQL. Used a lot in e-commerce.
2) document model: mongodb, couchdb or firebase. Rather than rows and columns, data is a document that has info together. These DBs are good
at scalability(DBs that have to hold more and more data).
3) key-value DBs: like redis, etcd and dynamoDB. These are key-value storage systems. It's a model that is one of the simplest ways to access data.
4) graph(graph model databases): neo4j . These DBs are complex and rare. A social network website might have graph DB because they want to see how
different users are connected to one another.
5) wide columnar: This model is new and they were pioneered by google big table. DBs like appcache cassandra, google big table.

## 12-12 - Exercise What Is A Database
A DB is a system, hardware and software, that allows a user to store, organize and use data.
