# Section 11 - Where To Go From Here
## 247-247 - Thank You
## 248-248 - LinkedIn Endorsements
## 249-249 - Become An Alumni
I have created the #alumni channel on Discord as well as the Alumni role so you can network with other graduates. Please let myself or
the management team know that you have finished the course so you can get the alumni badge in the community! Simply post your 
completion certificate in the #alumni channel and tag the @Management Team. If you have finished the course I highly recommend you join 
the channel and stay up to date and network throughout your career. You never know how it may come in handy in the future. (Ps, you get a
course certificate once you complete all lectures including the bonus ones!)

It would be great to have the alumni follow up on their career journey such as: *Did they find a new job?* or *Did they enroll in some further study?* or
even *Did they launch their own business/product?*

Many students would benefit from this and I hope you give back a bit to the community :)

## 250-250 - Learning Guideline
Since I get this question a lot, I've added an info graph to help you decide what skills you should focus on and what you need to learn to succeed as an engineer.

## 251-251 - Coding Challenges
We run monthly coding challenges as part of this course. Each month the challenge is selected to improve a specific part of what it takes
to be a great developer. These challenges will sometimes come with awesome prizes as well! If you are looking for extra practice,
project ideas, or want to keep your skills up to date, I recommend you keep an eye out on the monthly announcement email, or follow 
the #coding-challenge channel on Discord.

I also recommend you try some of the past challenges while comparing your code to other students from this course. You can find all of
the challenges that have happened in the past, including the current one you can join here.
